## **How RAG Works in ThriveChat**
1. **Document Embedding**: PDFs in the `data/` directory are converted into vector embeddings using HuggingFace Sentence Transformers.
2. **Vector Database Retrieval**: Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the Chroma vector database based on user queries.
3. **Prompt Augmentation**: The retrieved content is passed as context to the ChatGroq model.
4. **Response Generation**: ChatGroq generates a response that combines the retrieved context and user query.
